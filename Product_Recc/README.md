# Product recommendation

This is a product recommendation model, which runs on the general user's side of the website. This helps the user purchase exactly what they need, without having to waste their time searching the web.

## Add API key

You will need to add a `gemini` API key in the [source code](./Product_Recc.py) for this to work.

## Additional considerations

You may need to change the file paths if there are any errors (which shouldn't happen, but just in case)

## Requirements

Install the required libraries for this using

    pip install -r requirements.txt
